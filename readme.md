Deflection Game Instructions

Click on the screen to fire a projectile in that direction! Projectiles bounce off of walls and the screen edges, and your objective is to hit the green target with a projectile.

Levels are not guaranteed to be winnable, so you can also press the space bar to generate a new level.
